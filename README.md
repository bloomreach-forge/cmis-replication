# Retired Project!!!

```
As of 2017-07-14, this project is retired!
This site is kept online for archiving purposes for the time being.
Due to the lack of a developer community, the codebase was no longer actively maintained
and the synchronization based integration (between CMIS repository and JCR repository) of
this project has been too problematic to use in production in many cases.
The team therefore had no other choice but to retire this project.
```

# CMIS Replication

CMIS Replication Module provides replication of documents from CMIS repository to Hippo Repsitory. CMIS Replication Module reads documents from a dedicated (normally published) CMIS folder and upload the documents to a specified assets folder in Hippo Repository with CMIS metadata.

# Documentation

Documentation is available at [bloomreach-forge.github.io/cmis-replication/](https://bloomreach-forge.github.io/cmis-replication/)

The documentation is generated by this command:

```bash
$ mvn clean site:site
```

The output is in the docs directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically.
